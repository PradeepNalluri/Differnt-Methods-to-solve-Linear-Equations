 Many practical problems could be reduced to solving a linear system of equations formulated as Ax = b ,
 where 'A' is a given (n × n) non-singular matrix and 'b' is an n-dimensional vector ; the problem is 
 to find an n-dimensional vector 'x' satisfying the above equation . To solve them, two types of methods
 are normally used :  direct methods and iterative methods.

 As a part of the project we were supposed to write codes in 'C' language for direct methods namely LU
 decomposition(Dolittle's and Cholesky's factorization) and Gaussian elimination method. We were also 
 required to write programs for iterative methods i.e Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods.'C' code to 
 calculate norms(1-norm, 2 norm and infinity norms) and functions to read matrix and vectors from 
 a file were also written.
